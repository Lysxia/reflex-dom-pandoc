# reflex-dom-pandoc

Render Pandoc documents to HTML using reflex-dom, in your reflex or Obelisk apps.

## Todo

Nearly all parts of the AST are rendered, except the following:

- [ ] Table is rendered only in basic fashion; but its attributes are not handled.
- [ ] `Citation` (Pandoc's `Cite` node)
